The application under development is a squad roster builder for a tabletop miniatures skirmish game, a type of war game. The game is based around the movement of individual squad member and actions by these squad members (e.g. shoot/fight). The success of actions is based upon the roll of a D20 (20 sided dice).
This version is to fix the bugs and add log in system.
